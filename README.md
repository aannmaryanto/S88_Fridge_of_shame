FRIDGE OF SHAME - The expired food tracker

Project Overview:

Everyone has that one item in their fridge that’s been there way too long. This app helps users track their groceries and calls them out when they forget to use something before it expires. Users can log items, get reminders before food goes bad, and even compare their “Fridge of Shame” with others to see who has the most expired stuff.

Key Features:

-- Home Page with an overview of your current fridge status and quick actions.

-- Add to cart Users can add food items with expiration dates and get reminders before they go bad.

-- Search A Search Icon to quickly find items in your fridge.

-- Product Review A Product Review feature where users can rate and review food items (e.g., “This brand’s milk goes bad way too fast!”).

-- Shame Score A “Shame Score” based on how many expired items they’ve accumulated.

-- Uploading Picture Users can upload a picture of their expired items for bonus “Shame Points.”

Why This Project?

This project makes fun of a common problem while teaching core web development concepts like user authentication, CRUD operations, image uploads, and real-time notifications. The leaderboard and gamification elements make it engaging, while the AI-generated excuses add a quirky touch. Plus, it might actually help people waste less food!
